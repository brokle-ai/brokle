# 📊🚀 Brokle – The Open-Source AI Control Plane

**See Everything. Control Everything.**

*Observability, routing, and governance for AI — open source and built for scale.*


## 🌍 Why Brokle?

LLM apps in production often suffer from **blind spots**: no visibility, unpredictable costs, and fragile vendor lock-in.
**Brokle** solves this as **The Open-Source AI Control Plane** — See Everything. Control Everything.


## 🎯 What You Get Today

- **👁️ See Everything** – Track **40+ LLM-specific metrics** (latency, token usage, cost, errors, success rates) with complete observability and tracing.
- **⚡ Control Everything** – Intelligent routing, failover protection, and governance policies with **smart, OpenAI-compatible multi-provider routing**.
- **🔒 Stay in Control** – Full ownership of your AI stack — open, transparent, and free from lock-in.  

👉 Built for **production-grade scale**, extensibility, and the transparency only open source can provide.

**Governance means** cost controls, provider policies, and safe-usage guardrails baked right in.


## 🗺️ Where We’re Headed

Brokle starts with **observability + gateway** as the foundation. Next steps include:  

- **🔄 Smarter Caching** – Semantic-aware caching to slash costs and latency.  
- **🚀 Beyond Text** – Model hosting and observability for multimodal AI (images, speech, agents).  
- **🌐 Complete Control Plane** – From observability and routing to caching, multimodal, and compliance — Brokle is becoming the single control plane for all AI workloads.  

Step by step, Brokle is evolving into the unified open-source AI control plane — built for the needs of production teams.


## 💡 Why Brokle Stands Out

- **Open Source First** – Transparent, extensible, and community-driven.  
- **Developer-Friendly** – Drop-in integrations with OpenAI APIs, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more.  
- **Future-Proof** – From observability to routing to infrastructure, Brokle grows as your AI stack grows.
