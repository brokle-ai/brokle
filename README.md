# 📊🚀 Brokle – AI Observability & Gateway Platform

**The open-source control plane for LLM apps: visibility, routing, and beyond.**

*Built for transparency, extensibility, and control — with the flexibility of open source.*


## 🌍 Why Brokle?

LLM apps in production often suffer from **blind spots**: no visibility, unpredictable costs, and fragile vendor lock-in.  
**Brokle** solves this with an open-source platform that gives teams **full control over their AI infrastructure**.


## 🎯 What You Get Today

- **📊 Observe** – Track **40+ LLM-specific metrics** (latency, token usage, cost, errors, success rates) in real time.  
- **🔀 Route** – Prevent downtime and vendor lock-in with **smart, OpenAI-compatible multi-provider routing**.  
- **🕵️ Trace & Optimize** – Debug every request with **end-to-end tracing** and gain **clear cost insights** to optimize spend.  

👉 Built for **production-grade scale**, extensibility, and the transparency only open source can provide.


## 🗺️ Where We’re Headed

Brokle starts with **observability + gateway** as the foundation. Next steps include:  

- **🔄 Smarter Caching** – Semantic-aware caching to slash costs and latency.  
- **🚀 Beyond Text** – Model hosting and observability for multimodal AI (images, speech, agents).  
- **🌐 Unified Platform** – A single control plane to manage observability, routing, and infrastructure.  

**Long-term goal:** the unified AI infrastructure platform — built step by step on what production teams need most today.


## 💡 Why Brokle Stands Out

- **Open Source First** – Transparent, extensible, and community-driven.  
- **Developer-Friendly** – Drop-in integrations with OpenAI APIs, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more.  
- **Future-Proof** – From observability to routing to infrastructure, Brokle grows as your AI stack grows.
